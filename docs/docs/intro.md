# Introduction

Welcome to the **Agents MCP Server** documentation!

## What is Agents MCP Server?

Agents MCP Server is an intelligent Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that combines AI-powered agents with persistent memory, learning capabilities, and smart features. It serves as both an MCP server and client, enabling you to:

- **Manage Tools**: Store, search, and execute MCP tools from remote servers
- **Run AI Agents**: Execute complex tasks using AI agents (Thought, Planner, Executor)
- **Learn and Improve**: Memory system that learns from past executions
- **Benchmark Performance**: Track and optimize system performance
- **Make Smart Decisions**: Quality prediction, tool recommendations, and cost optimization

## Key Features

### 🧠 Intelligent Agent System
- **Thought Agent**: Analyzes user queries and generates structured thoughts
- **Planner Agent**: Creates executable plans from thoughts
- **Executor Agent**: Executes plans step-by-step with error handling

### 💾 Memory & Learning
- Pattern recognition and reuse
- Tool performance tracking
- User preference learning
- Insight generation from executions

### 📊 Benchmarking & Quality
- Automated test suites
- Performance metrics tracking
- Regression detection
- A/B testing support

### 🎯 Smart Features
- Plan quality prediction
- Tool recommendations
- Automatic plan refinement
- Cost tracking and optimization

## Who is this for?

### Engineers
- **Backend Developers**: Understand the architecture, API, and integration points
- **Frontend Developers**: Learn how to build UIs that interact with the server
- **DevOps Engineers**: Deployment, monitoring, and scaling guidance

### Non-Technical Stakeholders
- **Product Managers**: Understand capabilities and features
- **Business Analysts**: Learn about system capabilities and use cases
- **Decision Makers**: High-level overview of the system's value
